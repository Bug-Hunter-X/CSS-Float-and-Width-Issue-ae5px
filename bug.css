The following CSS code snippet causes unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This snippet attempts to make two divs occupy 50% of the available width each and float side by side. However, if the parent container does not have a defined width, the divs may not behave as expected, potentially collapsing or overlapping.
